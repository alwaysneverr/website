    <p>Welcome to Omniscient Reader's View- wait, no. No no.</p>

    <p>Na Kang-Lim is NOT Omniscient. He's smart, has charisma, and will go through great lengths to keep people he care about safe... but he's NOT the main character. He doesn't look handsome, he's a gamer, and he's not physically gifted, like the main character of this webtoon he reads!</p>

    <p>Well, to be fair, neither does Dokja... and he might be Omniscient, but he is also smart, has charisma, and will go through great lenghts to keep people he care about safe... but he is definitely handsome though. AND physically gifted. And he's kinda the main character...</p>
    
    <small>Okay yeah if I continue this, you wouldn't really get the reference to <i>Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint</i>, so I'll stop here.</small>

    <p>What took me so long to finally read this?</p>
    <small>Procrastination, it's always procrastination. Moving on...</small>

    <p>A romcom with a meta narrative that riffed off ORV? Literally the dream. I'm a sucker for romcom, as my anilist profile have shown. (As of writing this, I have 271 entries of Romance, and 198 entries of Comedy, that is visible on my anilist profile. I am a BIG sucker for romcom.)</p>

    <p>This series then also mixed it up by giving the MC, Na Kang-Lim... loop powers? Is this now a Re:Zero but romance?!</p>

    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>But seriously though, as the series progress, we get to be introduced to the heroines of the webtoon that Kang-Lim read, <i>Escape: Six Wives</i>, starting with the main heroine (also MC's favorite heroine), Yoo Da-Hee. Her being a (slight) twist on the 'good girl' archetype is pretty fun to watch, especially Kang-Lim crestfallen response knowing how Da-Hee really is. And her role in the following arcs as an ultra competent, 'it' girl, brought some chuckle out of me as she interacted with other heroines, but mostly her interaction with 'Boss' Kang-Lim brought the most mirth for me. Her slow realization that she is falling for Kang-Lim (and the usual tsundere-like denial) was something that could be seen as a tired trope, something we seen before already, but I just don't feel the same when Da-Hee did it, for some reason. It is probably tied to this platonic feeling that she has for him at first, that blooms into something more as we get to see more of Kang-Lim, which I feel is a more natural and smooth progression that I can really enjoy.</p>

        <p>There's also typical childhood friendship that crushes on the MC, Jung-Ah, a webtoon artist (dear god this is so meta) that fell in love with him after he give her an honest review of her works. Every time she came on, I just can't help but wanting to support her... I just really love her panicked face every single time a new heroine is introduced and starting to come on to Kang-Lim, though. XD</p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Then there's Sirin... or also known as <i>Rozentea</i>. The gamer girl. Ah, how your archetype is my weakness. It was quite funny that Kang-Lim got absolutely rejected with impunity the first time he met her, and how much of an utter girlfailure she is outside of her gaming skills. Her "match-fixing" arc has a pretty good resolution, especially that kidnapping climax.</p>

        <p>It really showcases how far Kang-Lim would go to emulate the main character... or rather, how far he would go to break the loop, since he would be forced to loop if he didn't save Sirin. This was a breakthrough moment for me when I read it, and it moves the needle for me from this series being an okay-ish parody of romcom mixed with ORV-like fourth-wall breaking, "I know of these development", into what I can only describe as late-stage ORV story where we started to resonate more with Kang-Lim. And as we approach Chapter 60, the resolution of this arc started to affect the story in a major way... I will DEFINITELY keep tabs on this. Surely Kang-Lim can do something about this...</p>
    </div>
            
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>And then there's Ra-Mi. Oh my god, Ra-Mi... I just can't with the teasing Kouhai type, man. Scheming, teasing, kouhai. That's a killer combo! This girl was dangerous to my heart. With the backstory of being a "fortune teller", combined with the "Shinomiya family"-like shenanigans, I must say, out of all of them, her backstory was quite enjoyable. Not like everyone else is bad, per se, I just really enjoyed her arc resolution a lot more.</p>

            <figcaption style="font-size: smaller;">Eun-sa, an adult. One of my personal favorite.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>There are other heroines that got their time in the limelight, like Da-Hee's second(?) sister Na-Ri, Sirin's associate Eun-sa... and other characters like Kang-Lim's sister Min-Jung, our resident chuunibyou Yong-su, and the hot-headed prick with heart of gold(?) Ho-Cheon. There's numerous characters that are yet to appear, that kept being mentioned, like Yong-su's favorite character Yerim, and Da-Hee's acquaintance Eun-young... either way, all of them piqued my curiousity and I wonder if they might play a bigger part later on.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Especially since we're only focusing on main heroine so far. Only non-heroine that has a spotlight up until Chapter 60 was Na-Ri, who is called a "sub-heroine" but has her moment, at least... this cute yandere-ass little sister...</p>

        <p>I will say, after sixty chapters, I am quite enjoying how the story has progressed so far. The blend of "I know of this development" MC mixed with romcom shenanigans are very fresh in my eyes, and I especially love how aware they are of romcom tropes as well, even discussing and directly lampshading it at some point, dissecting how they work, and ended up creating a new development out of it.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Especially that Ra-Mi and Sirin conspiring together before the sports festival, and especially Jung-Ah declaring how she would defy her own 'destined' position as a 'childhood friend'. I love when these... clearly losing heroine proudly declare that they will try their hardest not to be. I... I know they're losing though... but we all love our underdog story, don't we?</p>

    <p>I must say, though, even after all these meta-breaking tropes and heartfelt declaration, I still know who is going to win in the end. Who is this author fooling, thinking that the story would just change development to make a surprising heroine win... what is this, <i>Quintuplets</i>?</p>
