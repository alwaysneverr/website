intro : "<p>Hoo boy.</p>

<p>Let's start this review with a tangent. Have you ever eaten sweets so much that your stomach can’t handle it, and you begin to feel sick? Personally, I haven’t. Instead, I eat sweets so much that I started to get ulcers, which was entirely out of left field that I was surprised.</p>"

<p>This manga… well, I mean its first chapter is already quite the surprise, but it does feel almost the same as that feeling. I personally don’t mind the “relationship” that Sato has with Shio… at first. I was equating it more to her being kind of a guardian to Shio. But the more I read the manga, the more I realized that her love was more towards something else. Something that horrifies me the more I see her looking crazed in her attempts to keep things at status quo with her “beloved”...</p>
            
<p>There is this one panel where she addresses God to forgive her for lying to Shio about a sin that she did, and I swear, the way it is drawn, it was like she was addressing me, the reader. I feel chills from that.</p>
            
<p>This uneasiness didn’t really dissipate as I continued reading the manga. It just keeps building and building, the more the situation gets complicated, the more people start to become aware of Shio and who Sato is really. But that’s enough from the feelings department, as I’m pretty sure those who read this series are already aware of how “edgy” and “horrific” this series is.</p>
            
<p>Instead, I want to try and put into words if the author managed to deliver a poignant message about trauma, love, and how fucked up that can make you. I want to say that their attempts are… moderately working for me.</p>
            
<p>The manga successfully explores how love can really drive you insane, in my opinion. And when I say love, I really am stretching the definition of them to the limit right now. Sato’s love of Shio, that creepy teacher’s “love” for Sato, that creepy guy from Sato’s workplace love of Shio’s… picture?</p>
            
<p>Not saying that there’s not a normal love in the example, such as Shio’s brothers' love of Shio (I am not ready for him to die but he is so totally going to die by the end of this manga), and also Sato’s friend’s love for her.</p>
            
<p>Even if it ended up killing her.</p>
            
<p>I stopped reading the manga after that, which actually was fortunate because that was the cutoff of both the contract and I am pretty sure, the anime.</p>
            
<p>Let me say that if I am allowed to be biased about this manga I would have rated it way, way, less than what it is. Whenever I read it, I feel dread. I wondered, what kind of fresh hell would this manga bring in the next chapter. Which creepy fella going to be gunning for Shio now? What would Sato do in response?</p>
            
<p>It got so bad that I finished multiple fluffy stories, found out that I am actually into a particular kind of kink, and caught up and/or completed those stories, in between reading this manga in particular. I would not recommend it if you can’t stomach the uneasiness, and later on, just straight-up chill-inducing panels.</p>
            
<p>I will try to be as unbiased as possible and compartmentalize that part of me, though. I was given two options for my challenge contract, and I straight up said to my contractor, hmmm, I wasn’t sure about this series after reading the synopsis, but I wanted to challenge myself.</p>
            
<p>I guess I should say, be careful what I wish for. It really was a challenge trying to read this manga.</p>
            
<p>Anyway, for all its purposes, this series does feel like it was written to be as eerie as possible. All those fluffy moments between Shio and Sato always have this undercurrent of tragedy running alongside them, like a clean paved road with sewage underneath that you can almost hear and smell.</p>
            
<p>Like the fact that Shio was technically abducted from her family, the way Sato acquires the apartment that she currently lives in right now, Sato’s aunt, that last chapter in volume 5. It was masterfully written to be as eerie, and uncomfortable, as possible. I will still praise them for it. Paneling for the painter’s chapter taking place inside a frame, the creepy block of texts (the praise has to be given to the scanlations team for this one, I did not see the raws but they really make it creepy in my opinion).</p>
            
<p>Sato is very scary for 15-16 years old. I feel like she is part of the reason why I never enjoyed Yandere to the extent that other people do. The kind of Yandere that actually leans in more on the obsessive aspect of themselves, but also because the world hasn’t really been kind to her. From her aunt to her boss in her workplace, and even her fellow waitress.</p>
            
<p>To read this is to acknowledge that you are reading a story set in a bleak world, where the only way to survive is to love someone so much, too much, that you would do anything to keep it safe.</p>
            
<p>I will give this series a 6.9/10 rating. I’m keeping it below 7 for now because I personally can’t put a series I did not enjoy a rating above 7, even if it’s technically executed superbly, which this series does.</p>
