intro : "<p>This is the tale of a reader, only recently getting into Japanese media, and specifically only into mangas and very recently anime as well. The reader has known Visual Novel for the longest time, thinking of it as a game genre like any other, and the only difference between it and an audiobook or a visual audiobook is that it's specifically originated from Japan, before western media caught on and both translated them and also make their own visual novel.</p>"

<p>I'm not unfamiliar with it, but I never truly delve into the genre so far, only watching from the outside like a stalker watching their target.</p> 
    
<p>Why am I talking about Visual Novel in this review about a manga, you would ask?</p> 
    
<p>Well, dear Watson, as you can see, this manga was originally a Visual Novel. I was marketed (read: shilled) about this pretty hard coming in, and if you're wondering why I was contracted to read episode 2 and 3 instead of something like episode 1 and 2, it was because I already read episode 1 coming in, and this is only a journey I'm continuing with my partner in crime, friend, and in this case, contractor for the Spring 2023 season, Grace.</p>
    
<p>In this review, I would like to talk about the whole entire Question arc (Episode 1-4) instead of only Episode 2 and 3, but I understand that this would be killing the spirit of the contract. It is, however, impossible to review only the middle part of this behemoth of a story. The Question arc I mentioned is only the first arc of the two-arc story. I would instead try to be brief about episode 1 and episode 4 and bring up only the relevant parts, the rest would be focusing solely on the manga I contracted to read.</p>
    
<p>Indeed, the first episode started with a very eye-opening chapter, mystery abounds in the island of Rokkenjima, and it has mix of intrigue, sweet moments, and also very gruesome murders and the investigation behind it. It intrigues me, as much as I usually only read one mystery story, which doesn't make me an enjoyer of the genre, you can say. And the manga also delve into gore (not just in this episode), which would have made this an instant ban had I not ask for this contract myself. It all however, went useless in the end, because the real meat of the story began in episode 2.</p> 
    
<p>The whole story is about two people, Battler Ushiromiya, and The Golden Witch, Beatrice. It delves into their imaginary game of chess, with Beatrice's goal to make Battler kneel and admit that magic is real, in order to solidify her position in the world, summoning her properly. She does this by creating impossible murder scenarios taking place in the island Rokkenjima, with the Ushiromiya family (even including Battler himself, but this Battler is only a pawn in the game instead of a player) as the victims and possible perpetrator. Battler's objective is to deny that magic is real, denying her existence, by explaining how the murders that happening in Rokkenjima can be explained logically.</p>
    
<p>The premise itself going into episode 2 is interesting, but as the episode goes on, I get increasingly... put off by the amount of gore in it. It's not exactly a big presence in the first episode, but during the middle of the story, going to the end, there is a specific point where I get genuinely horrified at the thing unfolding. It's not just the aspect of gore that horrifies me, but also the clear lack of humanity behind the actions happening, which perhaps was the point being made at the time. To counteract this sadistic part of the story, the story usually injects us with a bit of heartwarming moments, but in this one, the only story we get to see is one between an abuser and her abused daughter. There is no hope spot at all in the story, it is the incarnation of that deep dark pit inside of you, and sometimes when I want to read a story, I do not want to generally face that deep dark pit that stares at me back with its abyssal eyes. And so my review and rating for Episode 2 is colored by that perspective, I genuinely did not enjoy reading that episode, so much that I considered dropping the contract entirely, but I was persuaded not to by Grace. I ended up grateful for that because the next two episodes were something else entirely.</p>
    
<p>Episode 3, and by extension Episode 4, contained some of the most emotional parts of the story, which I will not say specifically in order to preserve the spoiler. It broke me down, toys with my heart, then ate it before spitting it back out to my face, laughing at me the entire time. It completely gets me FINALLY invested in what is happening, but I indeed wish that it did not take the story this long to hook me like this. Episode 1 and 2 almost felt like a very thick cover and episode 3 and 4 is the true content inside the book, which makes it hard for me to say that you shouldn't judge this story by its cover. It is almost like the writer intentionally tried to drive away people with the first two episodes and reward those that stick with them with greatness. The Golden Land, even, one could say.</p>
    
<p>In the end, it is indeed a big rollercoaster of a story, that made me experience every emotion that I can ever experience reading a story. The writer for this one has successfully created a story that moves people, and if that is not high praise for an author, I do not know what is.</p>
